        <h2>Impact Kids</h2>
        <p>
          IMPACT KIDS The heart behind Impact Kid's ministry is two-fold. The
          first, to create a place to encounter a loving Father, and secondly to
          create an awareness and ease in hearing His voice. We want our kids to
          daily be aware of Him! Our time is spent in lots of play - building
          character and friendship - and having fun in His presence. We want
          happy, whole kids that walk in identity, purpose, and carry the fire
          of God!

        <h2>The Well (Young Adults)</h2>
        <p>
          THE WELL YOUNG ADULTS The Well is a dynamic young adults community
          (ages 18-30) centered around the tangible Presence of God. We believe
          that God is raising up a movement of young people who know how to host
          God’s Presence, walk in purity and power, and believe for the
          impossible! At our corporate gatherings you can expect a fresh
          encounter with Holy Spirit, expressive worship, a message and
          ministry.
